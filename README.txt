# Global Data (By Sergio García López)
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description:
Global Data is my ever first project about dynamic web application that joins styling and marks languages with real programming languages.

A while ago I was fascinated about Data Analysis and how it really worked. And it turns out that is really similar to what we learnt on this course.
Data Analysis basically uses raw data, transforms it and the shows it to other professionals to interpretate it.

    The job of a Data Analyst (or at least what i've seen) is just convert that raw data into human-elegible data.
    This means that we, as Data Analysts, have to proccess large amounts of information and then represent it into some charts for example, so,
    other people can do their job with those charts and analyze it.

Global Data brings one of the most large databases into a web-app, and, this database is: https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/search/dataset/0037712.
It is a World Development Indicators Database, and it is HUGE.

    The web-app uses Flask and JS (and obviously HTML and CSS) to interpretate all this data into beautiful charts.
    But before the web-app is ready to interpretate all this data, I had to convert this raw data into a real DataBase.
